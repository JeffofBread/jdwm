Subject: [PATCH] Unmanaged patch for dwm

This patch adds a new rule option allowing the user to specify windows that
are not supposed to be managed by the window manager.

This may include external bars, conky, widgets or desktop icons.

If a window is unmanaged then its size and position is controlled by the
window application itself, or you can control these using external tools.

As such you will not be able to resize or move a window within dwm like
normal managed windows are.

The patch adds a new rule option "unmanaged" that is intentionally placed
at the end of the rules options. This is because as long as the field is
at the very end you do not actually need to specify a value (it will
default to 0) which means that existing rules can be left as-is.

	/* class      instance    title       tags mask     isfloating   monitor  unmanaged */
	{ "Gimp",     NULL,       NULL,       0,            1,           -1,      0 },
	{ "Firefox",  NULL,       NULL,       1 << 8,       0,           -1,      0 },

Whether unmanaged windows should stay on top of other windows or not depends
very much on the program. It may be desirable to place a bar on top of other
windows whereas an application that provides desktop icons is naturally best
placed below all other windows.

As such the value of the unmanged rule plays a part:
   * 0 - the window is managed by the window manager
   * 1 - the window will be placed above all other windows
   * 2 - the window will be placed below all other windows
   * 3 - the window is left as-is (neither lowered nor raised)
