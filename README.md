# jdwm | homepage

jdwm is a custom build of [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) made by myself, JeffofBread. This is simply the homepage to help you choose and navigate to a branch as well as get a simple overview of the project as a whole.

## Branches

There are two main branches of jdwm, [`jdwm_pure`](https://github.com/JeffofBread/jdwm/tree/jdwm_pure) and [`jdwm_complete`](https://github.com/JeffofBread/jdwm/tree/jdwm_complete). 

[`jdwm_pure`](https://github.com/JeffofBread/jdwm/tree/jdwm_pure) is a stripped down and less integrated build of jdwm intended for those wanting a closer to 'base' dwm experience. It is intended for more experienced users who just want the patches and fixes jdwm has with none of the fluff of dependencies or scripts I have added alongside the base program.

[`jdwm_complete`](https://github.com/JeffofBread/jdwm/tree/jdwm_complete) however is the 'intended' or *complete* build of jdwm, with all of the scripts, assisting programs, and other features that really flesh out the experience. This is the build I would recommend to most anyone that is wanting to try jdwm.

[`patches`](https://github.com/JeffofBread/jdwm/tree/patches) is a branch dedicated to cataloging all the dwm patches used in jdwm and to credit their authors appropriately. This branch has little practical use for most users. 

[`screenshots`](https://github.com/JeffofBread/jdwm/tree/screenshots) is a branch that exists solely to hold screenshots of jdwm without them cluttering the main repository. This way they can be used in README (like you see above) without the user ever cloning them and using up bandwidth during download or unneeded space on their computer. Has little practical use for most users. 

[`wallpapers`](https://github.com/JeffofBread/jdwm/tree/wallpapers) is a branch that exists to hold wallpapers used by [`jdwm_complete`](https://github.com/JeffofBread/jdwm/tree/jdwm_complete), again to avoid cluttering the main repository and providing flexibility over whether the user wishes to download them or not. These wallpapers are used and defined in theme header files located in `/jdwm/dwm/themes/`, and the repository is cloned by default by `install.sh`.

## The future of jdwm

I still have many plans for changes and features, but currently don't have that much time to put towards this project, so don't expect too many updates, at least not rapid ones. If you would like to suggest ideas, features, or contribute, please either reach out on discord @jeffofbread, start a discussion here on github, or create a pull request.
