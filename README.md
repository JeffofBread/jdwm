# Jeff's dwm build

A basic build of dwm for myself and anyone who wishes to use it too. If you find any issues or would like to make a recommendation, feel free. Will be updated over time for myself and my needs/wants. If you like a version and want to use it again in the future exactly as it is, I recommend making a fork of it. 

## Installation for newbs

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JeffofBread/jeff_dwm.git
cd dwm-6.4/
sudo make clean install
```
