# jdwm

A custom build of [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) made by myself, JeffofBread. If you find any issues or would like to make a recommendation, feel free. This is a major work in progress and **will** change.

## Branches

There are two main branches of jdwm, [`jdwm_pure`](https://github.com/JeffofBread/jdwm/tree/jdwm_pure) and [`jdwm_complete`](https://github.com/JeffofBread/jdwm/tree/jdwm_complete). 

[`jdwm_pure`](https://github.com/JeffofBread/jdwm/tree/jdwm_pure) is a stripped down and less integrated build of jdwm intended for those wanting a closer to 'base' dwm experience. It is intended for more experienced users who just want the patches and fixes jdwm has with none of the fluff of dependencies or scripts I have added alongside the base program.

[`jdwm_complete`](https://github.com/JeffofBread/jdwm/tree/jdwm_complete) however is the 'intended' or *complete* build of jdwm, with all of the scripts, assisting programs, and other features that really flesh out the experience. This is the build I would recommend to most anyone that is wanting to try jdwm.

## The future of jdwm

I still have many plans for changes and features, but currently don't have that much time to put towards this project, so don't expect too many updates, at least not rapid ones. If you would like to suggest ideas, features, or contribute, please either reach out on discord @jeffofbread, start a discussion here on github, or create a pull request.
