\Hypertarget{md_README_jdwm}%
 A custom build of \href{https://dwm.suckless.org/}{\texttt{ dwm}} made by myself, Jeffof\+Bread. If you find any issues or would like to make a recommendation, feel free. This is a major work in progress and {\bfseries{will}} change.

{\bfseries{Notes before you install\+:}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Make sure you have all the necessary \doxysectlink{md_README_required-dependencies}{required dependencies}{1}, or issues could occur during installation.
\item For a more custom install process, check install flags (run {\ttfamily ./install.sh -\/h} for more info) and/or edit paths specified at the start of the script.
\item To edit things like your terminal alias before installation, edit {\ttfamily /jdwm/dwm/resources/jdwm.aliases}. This can also be done after installation by going to {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$\sim$}{\string~}/.config/jdwm/jdwm.\+aliases}
\item To edit what programs autostart with jdwm copy {\ttfamily /jdwm/dwm/scripts/jdwm\+\_\+autostarts.example} as {\ttfamily /jdwm/dwm/scripts/jdwm\+\_\+autostarts.sh} and put whatever commands/programs you want started in there. It will be installed along with other scripts to {\ttfamily /usr/local/bin} and run at login.
\item By default on install, {\ttfamily install.\+sh} will clone \href{https://github.com/JeffofBread/jdwm/tree/wallpapers}{\texttt{ jdwm\textquotesingle{} wallpapers branch}} into {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$\sim$}{\string~}/.config/jdwm/wallpapers/}. These wallpapers are used by the themes in {\ttfamily /jdwm/dwm/themes/}. If you are bandwidth or storage limited, you may want to \href{https://github.com/JeffofBread/jdwm/blob/2785f37afb877c014ec3e551911a805ec216c1cf/install.sh\#L235}{\texttt{ disable this step in the install script}} and remove/alter the wallpaper commands in the various theme files ({\ttfamily /jdwm/dwm/themes/}).

These are all programs or libraries jdwm relies on (specified in {\ttfamily ()}) in some way or another. To not have them would severely reduce the functionality or result in the whole thing being non-\/functional.

Also, if anyone would like to add more package managers or distros to this list, I would appreciate it, please either reach out on discord @jeffofbread, start a discussion here on github, or create a pull request.

This is not yet a comprehensive list, just a good place to start. All of the keybinds and button binds are found and edited in {\ttfamily /jdwm/dwm/config/binds.h}.



{\bfseries{{\bfseries{Keybind Quickstart}}}}\begin{adjustwidth}{1em}{0em}




These are just the keybinds I find myself using the most often, though "{}\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}quick\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}"{} might not be the best descriptor here. In the interest of keeping this a little shorter, I won\textquotesingle{}t include them here, but I would also recommend checking out the media keybinds as well.

All the original .diff files are located in \href{https://github.com/JeffofBread/jdwm/tree/patches}{\texttt{ jdwm patches branch}}. Needless to say that a lot of tweaks had to be made to many of these patches when implemented to make them all work together, so the .diff files may not represent exactly what is present in jdwm. These changes are to be expected when adding 34 patches on top of each other, and is not a fault of the original authors. Also, many of these patches were pulled from \href{https://github.com/bakkeby}{\texttt{ bakkeby\textquotesingle{}s}} incredible \href{https://github.com/bakkeby/dwm-flexipatch}{\texttt{ flexipatch}}, but I frankly don\textquotesingle{}t remember exactly which, though I have tried my best to provide links below. Also, major thanks to \href{https://github.com/bakkeby}{\texttt{ bakkeby}} and \href{https://github.com/FT-Labs}{\texttt{ FT-\/\+Labs}} for help with a few problems as well as for making their own builds of dwm, which I shamelessly pulled from.

\item Steam (specifically toast notifications) causing tiling issues.
\item There might be a conflict between dwm-\/ipc and pertag, where jdwm-\/msg does not always dump correct values. I will look into it in the future.

I still have many plans for changes and features, but currently don\textquotesingle{}t have that much time to put towards this project, so don\textquotesingle{}t expect too many updates, at least not rapid ones. If you would like to suggest ideas, features, or contribute, please either reach out on discord @jeffofbread, start a discussion here on github, or create a pull request.
